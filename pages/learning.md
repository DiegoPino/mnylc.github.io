## Lynda.com

lynda.com is a leading online learning company that helps anyone learn business, software, technology and creative skills to achieve personal and professional goals. We provide our members free access to Lynda.com Online Training in eight week increments.  During that access period, you will have free reign to take all Lynda courses. Certificates of completion are available for courses you watch in their entirety.  After eight weeks, your license will be inactivated and made available to the next member, but your user profile will be saved. If you like, you may then request renewed 8-week access to the tutorial library at a later date.

## Special Interest Groups

The library community encompasses a vast spectrum of interests, specializations, and disciplines. To support the interests of our members, METRO hosts an array of Special Interest Groups (SIGs). SIGs are open to staff from METRO member libraries, myMETRO members, and other interested individuals. SIG meetings are open to the public, and members interested in any particular SIG are welcome to join the SIG's discussion list.
