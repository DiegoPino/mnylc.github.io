Libraries are often the only place that patrons can get access to important proprietary software and resources; however, lifelong information and technology literacy entails being able to apply “library-acquired skills” across work, home, educational, recreational, and civic environments, within ever-changing budget constraints. This SIG welcomes all librarians and information professionals who would like to find/use/share Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) and Open Access (OA) resources, and who are interested in promoting an “open“ resource ecology.

Topics of discussion include developing outreach goals, establishing your library's identity, creating a successful library campaign from start to finish, lemonading a library disaster into something positive, developing assessment tools to conduct community analysis, building partnership, and crafting visual materials.


## Pop Culture SIG ##

Caroline Fuchs and Michael Handis, Conveners

To best serve today's patrons, librarians need a broad understanding of the wide spectrum of the arts and popular culture that are of interest to our users. From gaming to comics to cosplay to streaming video, librarians are becoming both advocates of and experts in these non-traditional collections. The Pop Culture SIG aims to engage librarians in a dialogue on the wide range of cultural productions and practices that are redefining library collections and the resulting changes in practice in librarianship. We welcome librarians from all types of libraries to join the discussion.

Melissa Morrone and Cynthia Tobar, Conveners

The Social Justice Special Interest Group welcomes all librarians, archivists, and other information professionals who are interested in activities on community-centered activism, social movements, and outreach. Through meetings, presentations, discussion groups, and other events, we will reflect on and rethink the intersections of libraries and archives with social justice struggles. Some questions we will explore include: How do the ways we preserve, analyze, document and mobilize our collections, instruction, and services connect with the work of community activists in their fights for racial, economic, and gender justice? What does it mean to have a commitment to social justice in our profession and practice? How does librarianship embrace, challenge, or hinder various forms of access to information, documentation, and archives?
