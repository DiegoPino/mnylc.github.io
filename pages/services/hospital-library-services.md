METRO distributes funds from the New York State Library to support acquisitions, technology upgrades and interlibrary loan services for hospital libraries. Some of these services to hospital and medical center libraries include:

* Collection development grants, which are available to hospital libraries that are members of METRO's Hospital Library Service Program. Applications are due by January each year, and grant amounts are based on factors including established need and current expenditure levels. A total of about $120,000 is awarded each year through this program. The current grant application is now available.
* Technology grants are also available to eligible libraries that are members of METRO's Hospital Library Services Program. Grants are available to eligible libraries that are members of METRO's Hospital Library Services Program, and the total amount distributed may range from $70,000-$100,000. The current grant application is now available.
* Medical Information Service Program grants are available to subsidize costs associated with interlibrary loans involving medical and health related materials. Grants are available to medical or hospital libraries, though other libraries may also be eligible to have the cost of its health-related interlibrary loans subsidized if the National Library of Medicine (NLM) or a Document Delivery Providers (DDP's) provided them. Grant funding is based, in part, on Docline interlibrary loan statistics.  The current grant application is now available.

In addition, METRO provides participating HLSP libraries:

* Information about grants and other funding opportunities;
* Continuing education, including courses offering Medical Library Association credits;
* An annual conference on current issues related to health and medical library issues; and,
* Free or discounted access to databases
