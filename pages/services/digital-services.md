In three steps, METRO helps member organizations bring forgotten historical artifacts from their basements to international audiences.  

### Digitization: The Culture in Transit Project and Digitization Grants

Culture in Transit, funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, takes shared digitization technologies and expertise to libraries, archives, and communities throughout the metropolitan New York area.  METRO has two mobile digitization kits. One is equipped with a flatbed scanner and a laptop loaded with image editing software; the other contains a digital camera and copy stand set-up. All of this packs up easily into two cases and a backpack. Our knowledgeable staff then helps members digitize and share the cityâ€™s rich cultural heritage online with the world.

In addition, METRO has funded nearly 100 digital collections over the past eight years. Digitization Grants provide funding to offset the technical and personnel costs associated with digitization projects. Approved uses for funds include hardware, software, outsourced services, consulting services, staffing, training, web design, project evaluation, and promotion.

### Hosting: Digital Culture of Metropolitan New York

METRO offers a collection hosting service for METRO member institutions to make their digital collections available online. Digital Culture of Metropolitan New York, or DCMNY, features digital collections and exhibits from participating libraries, archives, museums and historical societies located in and around New York City. DCMNY also serves as an easy on-ramp to the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA).

### Scaling: The Empire State Digital Network

More often than not and frequently by accident, institutions describe their digital collections with quirky, unique metadata that make their content hard to find on the web. Through a unique partnership with the NY3Rs Association, the Empire State Digital Network collects metadata from non-profit cultural heritage organizations throughout the state of New York, including libraries, archives, historical societies, and shares that data with the Digital Public Library of America.  Our expert team refines and normalizes metadata, exposes it to the DPLA for ingestion, and ultimately drives more traffic to digital collections across New York State.

## Resource Sharing

METRO has developed and maintains unsurpassed services to facilitate resource sharing among our member libraries. Our resource sharing services open the world of knowledge to patrons of our member libraries by providing access to collections around New York City and Westchester County.
