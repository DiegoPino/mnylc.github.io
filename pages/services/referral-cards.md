The METRO Referral Card system makes it easier for students and researchers to locate materials or research onsite at METRO member libraries.

The METRO Referral Card system offers two options:

* The Yellow Card allows patrons to search for a specific book or any other item at another METRO member institution
* The Blue Card allows patrons to search across entire subject areas at METRO member libraries

Blue and Yellow METRO cards are available by order. Please contact Mark Parson at (212) 228-2320, extension 121.

## How to Use the METRO Yellow Card  for Single Title Referrals

The Yellow Card gives patrons access to individual titles from other METRO member libraries. To participate in this program, patrons must:

* Verify that the desired title is not available in your library or in the public library system
* Identify a library that has the title available using OCLC, WorldCat, Docline, or related resources
* Check the library's listing in the METRO Directory of Members. (Remember: access restrictions may apply)
* Call or email the holding library to verify that the title is available and to confirm any access restrictions
* Fill out the card completely, including the source of verification

The host library must determine the period during which a patron may have access to the item.
Yellow Cards do not give users unlimited access to another library's collections and does not guarantee that materials will be available at a given time. In most cases, access is limited to the specific item indicated on the Yellow Card.

Instructions to the Host Library: Before facilitating access to a title for a patron through the Yellow Card Program, a contact at the host library should confirm the card information and collect the card from the user. The host library should submit all cards received to METRO at the end of each month.

## How to use the METRO Blue Card for Subject Referrals

The Blue Card provides patrons with access to collections at participating host libraries. To access this program, users must:

* Verify that a host library has a strong collection in your subject area
* Confirm in the METRO Directory of Members that the library is a Blue Card program participant
* Contact the host library to confirm any restrictions on access to collections

The host library determines the length of time that a user may have access to a collection.
The Blue Card does not give users unlimited access to another library's collections and does not guarantee that materials will be available at a given time. In most cases, access is limited to materials indicated on the Blue Card.

Instructions to the Host Library: Before facilitating access to a title for a patron through the Blue Card Program, a contact at the host library should confirm the card information and collect the card from the user. The host library should submit all cards received to METRO at the end of each month.
