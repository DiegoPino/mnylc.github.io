The Library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) at New York University seeks part-time Metadata Project Specialist for an Ancient World Digital Library project related to Central Asian archaeology. Reporting to the ISAW Head Librarian, the Metadata Specialist will be responsible for reviewing, assessing, and creating metadata for a large collection of digitized monographs and serials containing archeological scholarship on Central Asia for the Ancient World Digital Library.  

The successful candidate will: 
* review digitized publications quickly to determine whether they are within ISAW’s academic scope;
* determine whether publications are already available online, and if so, where;
* research copyright status of items;
* create relevant descriptive metadata using controlled vocabularies for the digital materials selected and upload them to an NYU digital repository, such as the Faculty Digital Archive, for ultimate publication in the Ancient World Digital Library.  

The Metadata Project Specialist is a part-time appointment for the Spring 2016 semester of up to 21 hours per week. Reappointment for an additional semester may be considered, based on performance and funding availability.

The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World is a unique center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, offering the Ph.D. degree through NYU’s Graduate School of Arts and Science. It has a wider geographic span than other programs that focus on the ancient world, incorporating not only Europe and the entire Mediterranean basin, but also the Near East, and Central, South, and East Asia. In its research and its teaching of doctoral students, ISAW emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach, one that transcends modern boundaries of nation. It supports scholarship that crosses customary disciplinary boundaries – art history, literature, archaeology, history, geography, geology, economics, and sociology, among others – to create a new intellectual framework for understanding the ancient world, and to train a new generation of scholars steeped in that integrated approach.
