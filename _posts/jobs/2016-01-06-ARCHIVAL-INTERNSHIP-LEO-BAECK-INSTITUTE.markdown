---
The Leo Baeck Institute (LBI) is a library and archive dedicated to the preservation and access of material to researchers of German-Jewish history.  Our researchers include academics, authors, and genealogists.  Leo Baeck Institute is a unique research facility, housing nearly 5,000 linear feet of archival documents and a library of 100,000 volumes. The bulk of our material is from Germany and Austria before the Second World War.

The intern for the archives will work with bibliographic records in LBIâ€™s Aleph cataloging system, belonging primarily to two projects:

1) The intern will oversee the shipment of material to our offsite storage facility, entering all necessary changes into the Aleph cataloging system. In addition, the intern will enter barcodes to archival boxes and organize the movement of material between the archival stacks and the warehouse, which involves filing, confirming, and organizing storage space, as well as physical labor.

2) The intern will help to update the bibliographic description and re-organize the holdings of the LBI Photograph Collection, which contains approx. 40,000 items.

Other tasks might include assisting and fulfilling reference and permission requests for archival material. 

Pay: $15.00 / hour -- 16 hours per week.
