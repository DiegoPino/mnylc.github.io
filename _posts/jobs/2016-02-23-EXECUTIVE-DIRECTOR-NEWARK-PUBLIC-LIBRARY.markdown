The Newark Public Library seeks a dynamic, visionary leader to serve as its new Director. Under the leadership of the Board of Trustees, the Director leads the Newark Public Library in developing a vision and implementing its strategic goals. The Director works closely with elected officials in the city of Newark and with other city departments, divisions and outside agencies. As a community leader, the Director must have the talent, skill, and energy to exercise considerable initiative, independent judgment and political acumen to ensure that library services complement the needs and desires of community residents.

Established in 1889, the Newark Public Library has a long history of innovation and service, including the distinction of having John Cotton Dana among the ranks of their prior directors. The historic four story main library and seven community branches are hubs of activity, with a wide variety of programming for children and adults. The Library has the largest and most extensive collection among public libraries in New Jersey and is one of the four designated research libraries in the state. Library services and collections are provided by an experienced staff of over 100. The Library has recruited a large group of active volunteers who assist library staff. In addition, a community-based Friends group works to promote and support the Library through used book sales and public programs.

The Library Board has recently launched a capital campaign developed to strengthen financial support for the Board's recently approved initiatives: strengthening and increasing children's literacy programs throughout the city, increasing their prominence as a digital community hub, maintaining and displaying the Hispanic, African American, New Jersey, and Special Collections through the creation of Heritage Centers at the Main Library, along with developing a new special collections space.

Successful candidates will bring to the role extensive experience in developing and implementing 21st century library services and programming, demonstrated skill in fundraising, a singular ability to work with diverse ethnic and cultural groups, an ability to form partnerships with a variety of constituent groups and a proven ability to lead, develop and manage both a staff and budget well. An MLS, or equivalent, from a program accredited by the American Library Association, and a minimum of seven years of increasingly responsible library management experience is required.
