title:  "Web Developer for Special Project Portal - Yivo Institute for Jewish Research"
date:   2016-01-05
---
YIVO seeks a developer to help it create a web portal that allows a federated search of digital resoures now being created for the YIVO Vilna Collections project, a 7-year international project to preserve, digitize, and virtually reunite YIVO’s prewar library and archival collections located in New York City and Vilnius, Lithuania. The project will also digitally reconstruct the historic, private Strashun Library of Vilna, one of the great prewar libraries of Europe.

The goal is to make these collections available to general audiences and scholars around the world in a free-access website [vilnacollections.yivo.org](vilnacollections.yivo.org), accompanied by materials for educators in both English and Lithuanian.

The proposed project involves the creation of two new YIVO websites: [library.yivo.org](library.yivo.org) and [vilnacollections.yivo.org](vilnacollections.yivo.org).

YIVO has a diverse set of electronic assets which, for various reasons, reside in disparate electronic storage environments. The systems currently in use include the Ex Libris tools **Digitool** and **Aleph** to store assets and metadata; **Archon** for metadata linking to Ex Libris assets; and in the future Ex Libris's **Rosetta**, and **ArchivesSpace**.

The digitized books and documents will reside in the digital assets management system (currently **Digitool**) of the Center for Jewish History, of which YIVO is a constituent.

Metadata for the digital objects, including bibliographic data, resides in both **Digitool** and **Aleph** (Ex Libris), allowing it to be discoverable in the OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog) of the Center for Jewish History. This metadata is/will be also discoverable at:
* YIVO’s separate branded gateway to its archival collections, **Guide to the YIVO Archives** website [www.yivoarchives.org](www.yivoarchives.org), built on a customized platform of the open-source **Archon**.  Metadata will be created especially for this website but the digital objects themselves will be drawn directly from **Digitool**.
* A website called **library.yivo.org** that will need to be created in the course of this project that will present a subset of Aleph records from the OPAC via OAI. Books and periodicals digitized for the project will be discoverable on this website.
