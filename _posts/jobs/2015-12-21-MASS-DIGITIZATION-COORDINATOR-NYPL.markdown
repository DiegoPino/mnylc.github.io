The Digital Imaging Unit of the New York Public Library is hiring a Mass Digitization Coordinator to serve as a primary architect of a range of new digitization streams -- e.g. rapid book scanning, high-speed microfilm digitization, and experiments with new approaches -- with the goal of dramatically increasing the volume, speed, and range of NYPL's digitization activities. The Coordinator will also help refine existing workflows and explore new options for large-scale reformatting through vendors and partnerships in order to deliver as much material as possible through the Library’s own online collection portals and other digital library access sites like the HathiTrust Digital Library and the Internet Archive.
