NYU Libraries seeks an engineering subject specialist to support the research and teaching programs of faculty, graduate and undergraduate students in applied physics, chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil and urban engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical and aerospace engineering.  This librarian serves as a library liaison with special emphases on building and curating collections in all formats; developing a program of extensive outreach, instruction, consultation, and research support services; and delivering responsive and innovative information services.  The Engineering Librarian collaborates on scholarly communication and data services initiatives and participates in collaborative research projects, including sponsored research projects.  Librarians play a key role in the educational mission of NYU by establishing strong collaborative relationships with faculty and students and connecting them to the services, content, and tools that meet their research, teaching, and learning needs.

The Engineering Librarian is a tenure track position based at the Bern Dibner Library located on the campus of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, NY.  The Engineering Librarian takes a leadership role on selected projects and initiatives within the NYU Division of Libraries.  The successful candidate works collaboratively with librarians in the Coles Science Center at NYU’s Bobst Library as well as other science and engineering librarians across NYU, including the NYU Health Sciences Libraries, NYU’s Courant Institute Library, the NYU Abu Dhabi Library, and the NYU Shanghai Library, to develop, deliver, and assess high-quality research support services.  Librarians at NYU participate in Libraries-wide committees and professional activities outside of NYU, and they also monitor developments and best practices to help ensure the excellence of the NYU collections and research support services.  The individual in this position reports to the Head of Science & Engineering for the NYU Division of Libraries.

Libraries at New York University serve the school’s 40,000 students and faculty and contain more than 5 million volumes. The Libraries supports NYU’s vision to become the first true Global Network University by collaborating and providing services to our 11 global academic centers and “portal campuses” in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.   New York University Libraries is a member of the Association of Research Libraries, the OCLC Research Library Partnership, and the HathiTrust. The Libraries participates in a variety of consortia and collaborates closely with Columbia University Libraries and the New York Public Library through the Manhattan Research Library Consortium.
