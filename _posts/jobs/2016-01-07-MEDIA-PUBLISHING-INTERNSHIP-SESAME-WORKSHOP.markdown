###Your Mission###
Sesame Workshop’s North America Media Products and Publishing team is looking for an intern to support a small staff on a wide variety of projects 2 days/wk for Spring 2016. This is a paid internship for a currently enrolled student (grad or undergrad).

###What we offer###
This is a chance to work for a small team that really values all its members and their contributions. It’s a chance to support Sesame’s mission while learning new skills and earning money. Plus, sometimes there are Muppets around.  

###Who You Are###
You are an organized person with a positive attitude who doesn’t mind administrative tasks and is willing to pitch in on projects as needed. You are very comfortable with computers, especially Macs, and familiar with Excel, Word, and Outlook. You are familiar with the concept of metadata, and might also know a few things about databases. You understand the online world, and know the difference between Twitter and Tumblr. You enjoy interacting with others, even the Oscars of the world.  

You are also a student who is enrolled for the 2016 Spring semester.

###Your Focus###
You will be focusing on archival art metadata, social media data support, app and ebook competitive analysis, and general editorial support.  

You will be doing some administrative tasks, such as copying and scanning (including original book art). You will be doing some data entry, including adding metadata to databases and running sales reports.  

You will not be going on coffee runs. You will not be doing mindless busy work.  

On occasion, and depending on skills, you will assist team members with a variety of more interesting tasks. Many of these involve our furry characters. 

###Possible Projects###
Here are some things you might do throughout the semester:
* Be the librarian to our book library and help organize samples of adorable Elmo books.

* Add missing metadata to archival art entries in a database.
* Compare prices across ebook sites to ensure consistency.
* Help the business manager set up social media posts.
