The Leo Baeck Institute (LBI) seeks someone to manage the digitization of the Arts and Objects Collection.  The LBI Art and Objects Collection comprises approximately 8,000 works of art, including paintings, drawings, watercolors, prints, and sculpture that document the history and material culture of German-speaking Jewry.  The Art Digitization Project is already underway with 1,000 works of art evaluated, digitized and re-catalogued to provide better access through a customized Web portal.  The goals of the project are to continue digitizing our art and object collection in conjunction with the Digital Lab of the Center for Jewish History to provide high-resolution scans and to improve the metadata of these records by providing more information about the artists and artworks, as well as subject, genre, and other relevant reference terms. This position requires a familiarity with art objects as well as with German.  This is a temporary, full-time position lasting for one year.
