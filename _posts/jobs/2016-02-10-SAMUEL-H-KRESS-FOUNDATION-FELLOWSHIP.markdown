The New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC), consisting of the libraries of the Brooklyn Museum, The Frick Collection, and The Museum of Modern Art, is pleased to announce the availability of a Samuel H. Kress Foundation Fellowship to support a post-graduate fellowship dedicated to training an emerging art librarian. Initiated in 2014, the NYARC program consists of two consecutive fellowships to provide hands-on training in the field of public information services in museum libraries. We are now soliciting applications for  the second fellowship which will last 28 months from the date of hire.

Expected rotation schedule:  
12 months at the Brooklyn Museum  
8 months at the Frick Art Reference Library  
8 months at The Museum of Modern Art Library

The Kress Fellow will spend time at each of the three member institutions, strengthening their core competencies in reference and outreach services. As each library represents a different focus within the museum landscape and each institution’s collection varies in scope, the Kress Fellow will have an opportunity to develop an unusually broad knowledge of art resources. Additionally, the Kress Fellow will assess the usability and interface design of a discovery platform that is part of NYARC’s Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded web archiving program to capture, archive, and provide access to born-digital art research materials. This joint endeavor provides a valuable and unparalleled opportunity for a recent information professional graduate to begin a career in an exceptional environment of learning, service, innovation, and collaboration.  We are very grateful to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation for its generous support.

Applications for the  2016-2018 Kress NYARC Fellow are now being accepted and will continue until the position is filled. The call for applications is posted [here](http://www.nyarc.org/content/career-opportunities) and copied below.
