Overview: In the spirit of continuing the important mission of the Collaborative Curriculum Revision Project (CCRP), through a series of workshops, over two academic semesters, the Bronx Community College Library High School Collaborative (BCCLHSC) seeks to develop long lasting partnerships with our top feeder high school librarians and teachers to better prepare future Bronx students for college, careers, and life.  As a team, we will work collectively to enhance a secondary curricular unit. This endeavor aspires to establish the role of librarians as leaders of change within their institutions and to promote inter-disciplinary partnerships.

The Facilitator will primarily be responsible for attending and facilitating workshops for the Bronx Community College Library High School Collaborative (BCCLHSC). Workshop participants include high school and higher education faculty members and librarians. Workshops serve the purpose of helping participants collaboratively revise high school curriculum from the point of a common understanding of the educational challenges related to high school and college. The facilitator will review and approve workshop documentation, monitor project progress, and consult with the primary investigators: Professor Carl R. Andrews and Professor Dickens St. Hilaire.
