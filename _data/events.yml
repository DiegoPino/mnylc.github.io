    html: 'The Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME): Development, vocabulary,
      and tools'
  description:
    text: "Many libraries and other cultural heritage institutions have begun to make
      their bibliographic data and vocabularies available as Linked Open Data, exposing
      the wealth of resources in libraries to the wider world of the Web. \nThe Bibliographic
      Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME) has been under development since 2011 and intends
      to be a replacement for MARC. It is both a general model for expressing and
      connecting bibliographic data utilizing Linked Data principles as well as a
      framework for describing information objects that intends to be compatible with
      previous bibliographic practices.This session traces the development of BIBFRAME
      since the release of its initial data model; explains it in the context of other
      Linked Data initiatives; provides an overview of the BIBFRAME vocabulary version
      2.0 with comparison to the previous vocabulary; demonstrates tools in development
      for transformation and editing; and discusses possible implementation scenarios.
      \nTesting of BIBFRAME is being conducted by multiple institutions for different
      types of resources and a current effort is as part of the Linked Data for Production
      (LD4P) project, scheduled to begin this spring. Columbia University is participating
      in the effort, investigating how BIBFRAME accommodates the description of art
      objects, both two and three dimensional. A case study will be presented on Columbia’s
      project, which is working to identify and document any descriptive needs of
      art objects that are currently not covered by BIBFRAME, evaluate other linked
      data ontologies and initiatives in the art domain, develop a profile for the
      description of art objects, convert a selection of art resources cataloged according

      attend: Librarians, archivists, and museum professionals who are involved in
      creating or maintaining metadata for their resources as well as students investigating
      bibliographic data in a post-MARC world. A familiarity with MARC is assumed.
      \nBy the end of this program, participants will: \n\ngain an understanding of
      the principles of Linked Data and how BIBFRAME fits in\nexplore the BIBFRAME
      model and how it might be applied to various types of resources\nget an overview
      of the BIBFRAME vocabulary 2.0 and how it has changed since the initial BIBFRAME
      vocabulary\nlearn about how different Linked Data compatible vocabularies might
      interact for resource description\nbe exposed to tools for converting MARC records
      and for creating native BIBFRAME data\nlearn about current experimentation with
      BIBFRAME\n\n  \nInstructor Bios: \nRebecca Guenther has 35 years of experience
      in national libraries, primarily working on library technology standards related
      to digital libraries. Most of her professional life has been at the Library

      <P>Many libraries and other cultural heritage institutions have begun to make their bibliographic data and vocabularies available as Linked Open Data, exposing the wealth of resources in libraries to the wider world of the Web.</P>
      <P>The Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME) has been under development since 2011 and intends to be a replacement for MARC. It is both a general model for expressing and connecting bibliographic data utilizing Linked Data principles as well as a framework for describing information objects that intends to be compatible with previous bibliographic practices.This session traces the development of BIBFRAME since the release of its initial data model; explains it in the context of other Linked Data initiatives; provides an overview of the BIBFRAME vocabulary version 2.0 with comparison to the previous vocabulary; demonstrates tools in development for transformation and editing; and discusses possible implementation scenarios.</P>
      <P>Testing of BIBFRAME is being conducted by multiple institutions for different types of resources and a current effort is as part of the Linked Data for Production (LD4P) project, scheduled to begin this spring. Columbia University is participating in the effort, investigating how BIBFRAME accommodates the description of art objects, both two and three dimensional. A case study will be presented on Columbia’s project, which is working to identify and document any descriptive needs of art objects that are currently not covered by BIBFRAME, evaluate other linked data ontologies and initiatives in the art domain, develop a profile for the description of art objects, convert a selection of art resources cataloged according to the Art Properties collection's local schema to the profile, and engage with related projects in the museum/art library domain.</P>

  description:
    text: "Good libraries thrive when they are guided by a strong vision and a realizable
      strategy for achieving it. \nStrategic Planning DIY is an interactive workshop
      for library directors, assistant directors, and senior staff. Our facilitators
      will share what makes a strategic planning process effective. They will introduce
      participants to planning tools that are scalable – tools that consultants use
      in facilitating the development of a comprehensive strategic plan and that also
      might be employed by staff and volunteers for strategic planning when the resources
      aren’t available to secure outside counsel. \nThis workshop will pay particular
      attention to planning that addresses some of the most challenging issues facing
      libraries today: financial sustainability, leadership development and succession
      planning, and programming. Topics will include forming a committee, conducting
      research, crafting a vision, setting goals, prioritizing objectives, and measuring
      success. \nOutcomes include: \n\nUnderstanding how a good strategic planning
      process works\nUnderstanding why and how a strategic planning process is useful
      to a library of any kind\nKnowledge of specific tools that libraries can use
      for the DIY strategic planning process\n\nRegistration for this event is $75
      for METRO, myMETRO, and ESLN members and $150 for non-members. The workshop
      includes a catered lunch. \n  \nAbout our instructors: \nAdam R. Gaynor is a

      Race and Class\" by Angela Y. Davis. A mainstay in feminist scholarship, Davis's
      book offers a deep and insightful view of early feminism and its relationship
      with racial equity issues starting back in the late 19th century. It's a must
      read for anyone who hopes to have a strong contextual and intersectional understanding
      of our society's current power structures as they apply to women and men of
      all nationalities and backgrounds.  Bring your brown bag lunch to METRO on May
      23, 2016 (we'll get started right at 12:30 to maximize our time together). There
      are plenty of restaurants nearby if you're not the lunch-from-home sort. METRO
      will have coffee and cookies available as well.  Registration is capped at 20.
      If you're unable to make it, please cancel your registration by signing in to
