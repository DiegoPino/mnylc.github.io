      topics related to our jobs and our workplaces, including: \n\n\nThe state of
      labor organizing in libraries (for example, CUNY's Professional Staff Congress
      and DC 37 in the public libraries) \n\n\nThe fight for state and city funding
      and how it affects public and academic libraries \n\n\nWorker cooperatives -

      \nThe 2014 Babson survey (and SIG-member experiences) have shown that although

      tuition, faculty are (1) largely unaware that Open texts exist, or (2) are hesitant
      to adopt open-texts because they cannot easily find the quality texts they need.
      The 2014 and 2015 Babson surveys (and member experiences) have also shown that,
      of those faculty who are aware of benefits to OA publishing, they are hesitant
      to negotiate/alter publishing contracts because they are unfamiliar with how
      to do so. \nThe Open Textbook session will review the various group-suggested
      Open Text resources and act as a brainstorming session to come up with a plan
      to facilitate finding E-text resources for your institutions, and to become
      familiar with the Open textbook processes in order to coach faculty through
      the adaptation or creation of a new textbook. \nThe Publishing Agreements session

  description:
    text: |-
      Whether you’re organizing an event, renovating or rearranging a space, creating a program, or implementing a grant, you’re managing a project. Project management can help you manage projects more effectively and efficiently. Learn tools and techniques for successfully planning, organizing, and administering projects. To best respond to the constantly changing library world we will be sharing principles and concepts from design thinking and agile project management.
       
      By the end of this workshop, participants will:


      Receive a basic overview of iterative and agile-like project management from a design thinking perspective
      Gain knowledge to successfully manage a project cycle from start to finish through hands-on activities and exercises
      Receive a project management toolkit
      Learn about tools, strategies, and techniques to manage projects and teams better 


       
      Presenter bios:
       
      Lisa Chow is half of People Interact, a consultancy that work with libraries and nonprofits to implement creative solutions to effectively improve individual and organizational performance by focusing on the human element. She has successfully initiated and managed multiple projects including BPL ThinkTank staff unconference, Library Workers’ Skill Share, HealthCampNYC regional unconference, and Book a Librarian reference service among others. Lisa has a few "library ribbons" including SLA Rising Star, LJ Mover & Shaker, ALA Emerging Leader and ARL Diversity Scholar. She completed a project management certificate at New York University in 2014. Check out Lisa’s e-portfolio at http://bit.ly/lisachow.
       
      Sandra Sajonas is the other half of People Interact. Though she does not have a formal project management education, she has honed her project management skills in the library working directly with projects including a NYC wide “disconnected youth” grant initiative, web site transfers, Book a Librarian, department mergers and several unconferences.

    html: 'The Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME): Development, vocabulary,
      and tools'
  description:
    text: "Many libraries and other cultural heritage institutions have begun to make
      their bibliographic data and vocabularies available as Linked Open Data, exposing
      the wealth of resources in libraries to the wider world of the Web. \nThe Bibliographic
      Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME) has been under development since 2011 and intends
      to be a replacement for MARC. It is both a general model for expressing and
      connecting bibliographic data utilizing Linked Data principles as well as a
      framework for describing information objects that intends to be compatible with
      previous bibliographic practices.This session traces the development of BIBFRAME
      since the release of its initial data model; explains it in the context of other
      Linked Data initiatives; provides an overview of the BIBFRAME vocabulary version
      2.0 with comparison to the previous vocabulary; demonstrates tools in development
      for transformation and editing; and discusses possible implementation scenarios.
      \nTesting of BIBFRAME is being conducted by multiple institutions for different
      types of resources and a current effort is as part of the Linked Data for Production
      (LD4P) project, scheduled to begin this spring. Columbia University is participating
      in the effort, investigating how BIBFRAME accommodates the description of art
      objects, both two and three dimensional. A case study will be presented on Columbia’s
      project, which is working to identify and document any descriptive needs of
      art objects that are currently not covered by BIBFRAME, evaluate other linked
      data ontologies and initiatives in the art domain, develop a profile for the
      description of art objects, convert a selection of art resources cataloged according
      to the Art Properties collection's local schema to the profile, and engage with
      related projects in the museum/art library domain. \nThis event is intended
      for professionals and students who are interested in learning about the evolution
      of BIBFRAME, how it models bibliographic data as Linked Data, tools for experimentation,
      and rhow it is being tested to describe art related resources. \nWho should
      attend: Librarians, archivists, and museum professionals who are involved in
      creating or maintaining metadata for their resources as well as students investigating
      bibliographic data in a post-MARC world. A familiarity with MARC is assumed.
      \nBy the end of this program, participants will: \n\ngain an understanding of
      the principles of Linked Data and how BIBFRAME fits in\nexplore the BIBFRAME
      model and how it might be applied to various types of resources\nget an overview
      of the BIBFRAME vocabulary 2.0 and how it has changed since the initial BIBFRAME
      vocabulary\nlearn about how different Linked Data compatible vocabularies might
      interact for resource description\nbe exposed to tools for converting MARC records
      and for creating native BIBFRAME data\nlearn about current experimentation with
      BIBFRAME\n\n  \nInstructor Bios: \nRebecca Guenther has 35 years of experience
      in national libraries, primarily working on library technology standards related
      to digital libraries. Most of her professional life has been at the Library
      of Congress developing national and international standards related to metadata.
      She is currently consulting on metadata issues and, among others, has had as
      clients the Library of Congress, the New York Art Resources Consortium, and
      the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. In addition she is an adjunct
      professor at NYU’s Moving Image Archiving and Preservation Program and Pratt’s
      School of Information and Library Science. She has given several workshops at
      Metro in the past. \nMelanie Wacker will present on Columbia’s BIBFRAME experimentation.
      She is Metadata Coordinator at Columbia University Libraries and Information
      Services. She works with colleagues across the organization to ensure the integration
      of digital metadata with local and national systems to enable information discovery.
      Her responsibilities include development of application profiles for digital
      collections, metadata creation, training and consultations, cataloging of electronic
      resources and NACO/SACO work. "
