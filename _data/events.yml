      As the Internet continues to grow, social media websites, search engines, and even our government have unprecedented access to our personal information. It's easy to enjoy the convenience of having the world's information at our fingertips, but there are trade-offs to consider.
      As providers of Internet access in neighborhoods, librarians are on the front lines of helping patrons navigate privacy online. Librarians can play a critical role in protecting the right to search for information without tracking or surveillance, and in helping library patrons be safe online.
      Please join us for an interactive training that will cover concepts and tools related to digital privacy. It will address questions such as:

      What are the key elements of information security? 
      How does data profiling work? 
      How is personal information shared across websites? 
      What are the different digital services, devices, and networks at libraries through which patron data passes?

      Participants will come away with improved familiarity with how data travels across the Internet and within library systems, as well as available resources for ongoing learning.
      ***This workshop is open to anyone who would like to come. Please feel free to RSVP even if you are not employed by NYPL.***

      Whether or not you've joined us for our Fundamental Concepts course, this workshop is a great chance to understand the mechanisms involved in helping our library patrons navigate the new frontier of surveillance through our networked systems.
      Get hands-on practice with tactics and tools that can help your patrons have more control over their data and communications online. We will cover tools that library systems have already put in place, as well as others that are freely available online.
      This training will include sections on risk assessments, password managers, 2-factor authentication, VPNs, Tor, antivirus solutions, and anti-tracking software.

      Please join METRO's STM SIG for a meeting in the library conference room at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at 524 W 59th Street in Manhattan. The featured speakers will be:

      Linda Beninghove, Director of the Samuel C. Williams Library of Stevens Institute of Technology


      Judy Cohn, Assistant Vice President for Information Services and Director of Health Sciences Libraries, Rutgers University (formerly known as the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey)

      Both speakers will discuss their perspective of science or medical libraries as they are today and predict future trends. These presentations will be followed by a roundtable discussion.
      Please note that this meeting will be held at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at 524 W 59th Street in Manhattan. The library conference room is on the upper level of the Loyd Sealy Library.
      The easiest way to get there is to enter the Haaren Hall building of John Jay College at the Tenth Avenue entrance (opposite the hospital, between 58th and 59th street). Take the escalator or stairs down one floor, turn around to enter the library. Turn left inside the library, walk to the stairs at the end of the lounge, and go up one floor; ask for further directions at the reference desk at the top of the internal staircase.
      (People choosing to take the elevator at the Tenth Avenue building entrance will exit on the correct library floor, and should go through the stacks to the reference desk in the center of the library for further directions.)
      Please bring your photo ID for security purposes.
