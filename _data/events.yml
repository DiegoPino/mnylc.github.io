      Whether or not you've joined us for our Fundamental Concepts course, this workshop is a great chance to understand the mechanisms involved in helping our library patrons navigate the new frontier of surveillance through our networked systems.
      Get hands-on practice with tactics and tools that can help your patrons have more control over their data and communications online. We will cover tools that library systems have already put in place, as well as others that are freely available online.
      This training will include sections on risk assessments, password managers, 2-factor authentication, VPNs, Tor, antivirus solutions, and anti-tracking software.

      As the Internet continues to grow, social media websites, search engines, and even our government have unprecedented access to our personal information. It's easy to enjoy the convenience of having the world's information at our fingertips, but there are trade-offs to consider.
      As providers of Internet access in neighborhoods, librarians are on the front lines of helping patrons navigate privacy online. Librarians can play a critical role in protecting the right to search for information without tracking or surveillance, and in helping library patrons be safe online.
      Please join us for an interactive training that will cover concepts and tools related to digital privacy. It will address questions such as:

      What are the key elements of information security? 
      How does data profiling work? 
      How is personal information shared across websites? 
      What are the different digital services, devices, and networks at libraries through which patron data passes?

      Participants will come away with improved familiarity with how data travels across the Internet and within library systems, as well as available resources for ongoing learning.

      Librarians are often asked to facilitate citation management training. This workshop will provide training in the new version of the popular citation management tool RefWorks, as well as discussion and support on strategies, tips, and practices for teaching RefWorks. We will only briefly touch on the transition from “Legacy RefWorks” to “New RefWorks.”*
      Participants will be able to set up a trial “New RefWorks” account for the purposes of this hands-on workshop. This session is open to librarians from public, academic, and special libraries.
      The first half of the workshop will include a basic introduction to features and functionality of the New RefWorks interface, geared toward new users who are interested in getting started with RefWorks. After a break, we will briefly address advanced features (e.g., custom fields, customized citation styles, and reading/highlighting/annotating PDFs) and play around a bit with RefWorks’ Microsoft Word and Google Docs add-ins. Finally, we will discuss approaches and strategies for RefWorks training. Prerequisite knowledge/experience:
      No prior experience necessary. This workshop is open to librarians from public, academic, and special libraries who are interested in learning how to use the new version of the citation manager RefWorks, and how to teach colleagues and users to effectively use the tool.By the end of this program, participants will:

      Be able to use RefWorks to locate, save, organize, and share citations and documents
      Know how to add references to Microsoft Word and Google Docs documents
      Practice a few advanced RefWorks features
      Be prepared to train users on RefWorks at their libraries.

      Laptops will be provided for this workshop. This class will be led by Linda Miles, Librarian for Public Services & User Experience at Yeshiva University.

      *More information on the transition is available on the ProQuest RefWorks Customer Resources Page.

      Conversation'
  description:
    text: |-
      Focus groups are a great research tool for gathering feedback on new products or programs and better understanding your library’s community. By learning to facilitate or moderate a focus group discussion, you can uncover multiple perspectives or find out what people have in common within a cohort.
      This workshop will offer hands on practice in designing and running focus groups. We will cover the following topics:

      Why Focus Groups?
      Focus Group Design: Questions, People, Place
      Facilitating An Inclusive Conversation
      Data Collection & Analysis

      By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

      Understand the context in which focus groups will add a helpful dimension to data collection
      Generate a set of useful questions for use in the focus group setting
      Foster a congenail atmosphere in which participants are comfortable contributing
      Utilize collected data to build hypotheses around a set of research questions

      This workshop is intended for professionals and students who are interested in learning how to build research and facilitation skills, and design for diverse audiences. 
      Due to time contraints, this workshop will not go in depth on the qualitative data analysis process. Look for future METRO workshops on this topic.

    text: Integrating Digital Forensics into Born-Digital Preservation Workflows with
      BitCurator
    html: Integrating Digital Forensics into Born-Digital Preservation Workflows with
      BitCurator
  description:
    text: |-
      Over the last several years, archivists working with born-digital collections have begun integrating digital forensics tools and methodologies into their digital curation practices. As Cal Lee—a researcher at UNC Chapel Hill’s School of Information and Library Science—has noted, “The incorporation of digital forensics tool sand methods into archival workflows has changed the landscape dramatically. Digital forensics can help to advance a variety of digital curation goals and activities, including: creating authentic copies of data on disks; establishing a trustworthy chain of custody; capturing file-level metadata; and identifying personally identifiable information.” However, the promise of digital forensics in a collecting environment means that librarians and archivists need additional skills in order to fully employ these powerful new tools.
      This workshop is designed to help collecting professionals bridge the technical gap between the world of libraries, archives and museums and that of digital forensics. The workshop begins by first building a foundational understanding of digital media and born-digital content. From there we explore the scope and capabilities of digital forensics tools in an archival context and how to incorporate them into preservation and curatorial practices. We will use the open source digital forensics tools integrated into the BitCurator Environment to apply these concepts in a real-world collecting institution setting. Specifically, attendees will learn how to create forensic images (bit-for-bit copies of data from external media), scan a disk image for sensitive information, generate digital forensics metadata at the disk and file level, and analyze the contents of a disk image using the BitCurator reports. In addition to software tools, we will discuss digital forensics hardware such as write-blockers and the hardware tools available for accessing data on legacy media.
      Learning Objectives:

      Understand foundational digital forensics concepts
      Be able to create forensics disk images
      Know how to install and run the BitCurator Environment
      Generate digital forensics metadata and the BitCurator reports
      Scan digital content for personally identifiable information
      Know the hardware necessary to access the full range of legacy carrier media
      Be able to integrate digital forensics tools and methods in digital curation workflows

      Who should attend?
      Librarians, archivists and those working at collecting institutions who are, or will be, tasked with processing hybrid or born-digital collections. Also iSchool students or anyone interested in understanding the potential role of digital forensics in a collecting institution.
      Fees for this workshop are $75 for METRO and myMETRO members and $150. Laptops with all necessary software will be provided.
      Instructor Bio:
      Porter Olsen is a Ph.D. candidate in the English Department at the University of Maryland studying world literature and digital cultures. While at Maryland, Porter has worked at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), primarily on the BitCurator Project. From October 2013 to September 2014 Porter worked full-time as the BitCurator community lead, helping to build the BitCurator user base through outreach and engagement activities across the United States and Europe. He continues to conducted trainings and workshops on BitCurator and the application of digital forensic to digital preservation. He also serves as a member of the BitCurator Consortium’s executive council. He currently teaches in the Design, Cultures & Creativity Honors Program at the University of Maryland.  
      In his dissertation research Porter studies the intersections of world literature and digital cultures, with an emphasis on Postcolonial Digital Humanities. He has presented his research at a number of national and international conferences, including the annual MLA, Digital Humanities, and Electronic Literature conferences. He is author of the “Postcolonial Digital Humanities” article in the recently published Encyclopedia of Postcolonial Studies.
      Before graduate school, Porter worked as product manager for a Linux distribution developer and was a contributing member of the United Linux initiative.

In addition to software tools, we will discuss digital forensics hardware such as write-blockers and the hardware tools available for accessing data on legacy media.</P>

      Please join our Circulation and Reserves Special Interest Group on August 10, 2016 from 2:00 until 4:00 p.m. for a discussion focusing on Electronic Reserves:

      copyright best practices and copyright education for librarians and reserve staff
      new E-Reserves platforms
      ebook use in your library
      problems managing E-Reserves and hardcopy reserves separately (do you use Aleph to manage your hardcopy reserves?)
      promoting E-Reserves in your library (is use growing/dwindling? is this service still relevant to your library?)

      Other questions and topics (Reserve-related or otherwise) are also welcome! See you there.

      Whether or not you've joined us for our Fundamental Concepts course, this workshop is a great chance to understand the mechanisms involved in helping our library patrons navigate the new frontier of surveillance through our networked systems.
      Get hands-on practice with tactics and tools that can help your patrons have more control over their data and communications online. We will cover tools that library systems have already put in place, as well as others that are freely available online.
      This training will include sections on risk assessments, password managers, 2-factor authentication, VPNs, Tor, antivirus solutions, and anti-tracking software.
